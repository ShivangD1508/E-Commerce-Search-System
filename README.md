E-commerce Search System

Description

This project focuses on analyzing E-commerce search results using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It includes the implementation of Bag of Words (BoW), Word2Vec, and Transformer-based models, alongside Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to extract insights and predictions from e-commerce datasets.
The project also provides step-by-step explanations and proposals to make the analyses reproducible and insightful.

Features

Bag of Words Model: Implementation and detailed step-by-step explanation.

Word2Vec Model: Word embeddings for semantic analysis of reviews.

Transformer-based Models: Utilization of datasets for state-of-the-art NLP approaches.

Artificial Neural Networks: Implementation for predictive modeling.

E-commerce Dataset Analysis: Insights derived from product-related datasets.
