### Description
This project focuses on analyzing E-commerce search results using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It includes the implementation of Bag of Words (BoW), Word2Vec, and Transformer-based models, alongside Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to extract insights and predictions from e-commerce datasets. The project also provides step-by-step explanations and proposals to make the analyses reproducible and insightful.

### Features
- **Bag of Words Model**: Implementation and detailed step-by-step explanation.
- **Word2Vec Model**: Word embeddings for semantic analysis of reviews.
- **Transformer-based Models**: Utilization of datasets for state-of-the-art NLP approaches.
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Implementation for predictive modeling.
- **E-commerce Dataset Analysis**: Insights derived from product-related datasets.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Transformers

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivangD1508/e-commerce-search-results-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-book-reviews-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Usage Instructions
1. Open and run the desired notebook to reproduce results.
2. Use the datasets to perform custom analyses.
3. Refer to the proposal and documentation for a deeper understanding of the models.
